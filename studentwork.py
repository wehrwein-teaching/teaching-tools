"""
This script uses the canvasapi library to connect to a Canvas instance,
retrieve submissions for specified assignments, and download three sample
submissions based on score quantiles: the highest score, the median score,
and the lowest score.

Config:

Fill in the configuration variables below:
- API_URL: The base URL of your Canvas instance (e.g., "https://yourschool.instructure.com").
- API_KEY: Your Canvas API access token.
- COURSE_ID: The numerical ID of the course you want to access.
- DOWNLOAD_DIR: The destination download directory
- ASSIGNMENT_NAMES: A list of assignment names to process.

Setup:

Either install the canvasapi module and run this with python as usual, or use uv:
0.  Install uv - see https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
1.  Run: 
      uv run studentwork.py
